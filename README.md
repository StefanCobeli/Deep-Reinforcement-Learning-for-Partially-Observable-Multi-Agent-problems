# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observable Multi-Agent problems

<sup>The source code for the Bachelor degree in Computer Science.</sup>

We apply Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to solve popular riddles,
in which team work is highly needed. The agents need to learn how to cooperate 
in order to improve their results.  

## Analyzed riddles
We bring into discussion the _Hats riddle_ (*hats_riddle_keras.ipynb*), 
the _Switch riddle_ (*switch_riddle_keras.ipynb*)
and the _Hats<sup>*</sup> problem_ (*hat_problem_sumary.ipynb*).


### Supplementary material
The folder **results** contains plots, statistics and keras models obtained from this project.  

The folder **other attepmts** contains some unsuccessful experients.
