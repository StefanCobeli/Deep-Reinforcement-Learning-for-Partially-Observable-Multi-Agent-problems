# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observable Multi-Agent problems

The source code for the Bachelor degree in Computer Science.

In the notebooks *hats_riddle_keras.ipynb* and *switch_riddle_keras.ipynb* can be foud a Python implementation for the problems proposed in the paper [Learning to Communicate to Solve Riddles with Deep Distributed Recurrent Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02672?context=cs).

In the notebook *hat_problem_sumary.ipynb* there is the description of similar problem tackled with Reinforcement Learning.

The folder **results** contains plots, statistics and keras models obtained from this project.  

The folder **other attepmts** contains some unsuccessful experients.
