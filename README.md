# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observable Multi-Agent problems

<sup>The source code for the Bachelor degree in Computer Science.</sup>

We apply Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to solve popular riddles,
in which team work is highly needed. The agents need to learn how to cooperate 
in order to improve their results.  

## Analyzed riddles
We bring into discussion the [_Hats riddle_](https://github.com/StefanCobeli/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Partially-Observable-Multi-Agent-problems/blob/master/hats_riddle_keras.ipynb), 
the [_Switch riddle_](https://github.com/StefanCobeli/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Partially-Observable-Multi-Agent-problems/blob/master/switch_riddle_keras.ipynb)
and the [_Hats<sup>*</sup> problem_](https://github.com/StefanCobeli/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Partially-Observable-Multi-Agent-problems/blob/master/hat_problem_sumary.ipynb).
